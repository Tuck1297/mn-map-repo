## Project Overview

This project focused on creating a single-page, economical and feature driven application that through an interactive map users can easily look up and/or find specific information about any of Minnesota's State Parks, Recreation Areas, National Forests, Waysides, or campgrounds. Although in its earliest stages, this project aims to become a website that all outdoor enthusiasts in Minnesota can come visit to get the info they need for their next adventure. The front end work is done using Vue3 and the back end and hosting currently is managed by Firebase. As the roadmap outlines below, this project will be reengineered in React to accomodate future growth of this project. Overall, this project is a perfect example of providing a easy way to find new outdoor experiences while eliminating hours of research. 

#### You can check out the beta release of this project showcasing the interactive map component [here](https://map-mn.web.app/). For the best experience have your browser set to full screen.
